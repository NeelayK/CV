            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am an enthusiastic Data Science student at IISER TVM with a strong passion for coding and data analytics. My skills and interests span across various domains, and I am committed to expanding my expertise.
                <br> <br>
                My experience in robotics includes participating in various events organized by BITS Goa and other institutions, building projects using Arduino for most occasions. I was introduced to programming at an early age and have always been fascinated by how technology works.
                <br> <br>
                I served as a web developer for my schoolâ€™s website at Mushtifund High School in Goa. The project was discontinued after all the contributors, including myself, graduated. In addition, I also developed skills in video editing, recognizing its value as a versatile tool for many occasions.
                Furthermore, I participated in a Hackathon where I contributed to an innovative project called the Automated Baby Sitter, using Alexa, Lego, and some <a href="https://www.hackster.io/legogoa/alexa-automated-babysitter-688ded" target="_blank">coding...</a>
                <br>This project was later reworked with Alexa and Raspberry Pi, further expanding into home automation applications.
